# Generative AI Extractive Question and Answers

## Description
### Tagline
Create a chatbot powered by an extractive QA LLM model.

### Detailed
This solution showcases how to extract question & answer pairs out of documents
using Generative AI. It provides end-to-end demonstration of QA extraction and
fine-tuning of a large language model (LLM) on Vertex AI. Along the way, the
solution utilizes Cloud Vision Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Firestore,
Vertex AI Pipelines, and Cloud Run.

### PreDeploy
To deploy this blueprint you must have an active billing account and billing permissions.

## Architecture

<!-- TODO: Update the image with the correct diagram -->

The solution has three separate, but related workflows: ingestion, training,
and fulfillment.

### Ingestion

1. The developer uploads a PDF to a Cloud Storage bucket, using `gsutil`, the Console UI, or 
   the Cloud Storage client libraries.
1. The uploaded PDF file is sent to a Cloud Function. This function handles PDF file processing.
1. The Cloud Function uses Cloud Vision OCR to extract all text from the PDF file.
1. The Cloud Function uses Vertex AIâ€™s LLM API to extract question and answer pairs from the extracted text.
1. The Cloud Function stores the extracted question and answer pair in a Firestore collection.

### Training

1. Once the Firestore collection reaches a certain size (% 10), the Cloud 
   Function triggers a Vertex AI Pipeline.
1. The Vertex AI Pipeline fine-tunes a LLM on the QAs stored in the Firestore collection.
1. The Vertex AI Pipeline deploys the tuned LLM to a Vertex AI endpoint.

### Fulfillment

1. A Cloud Run instance hosts a simple chatbot user interface, where the chatbot
   queries the tuned LLM.
1. Users can ask the chatbot questions, and the chatbot respond with an
   answer derived from the source Q&As.
