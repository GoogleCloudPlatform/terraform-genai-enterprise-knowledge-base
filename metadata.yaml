      detailed: |-
        This solution showcases how to extract question & answer pairs out of documents
        using Generative AI. It provides end-to-end demonstration of QA extraction and
        fine-tuning of a large language model (LLM) on Vertex AI. Along the way, the
        solution utilizes Cloud Vision Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Firestore,
        Vertex AI Pipelines, and Cloud Run.

      - 1. The developer follows a tutorial on a Jupyter Notebook, where they upload a PDF — either through Vertex AI Workbench or Colaboratory.
      - 2. The uploaded PDF file is sent to a function running on Cloud Functions. This function handles PDF file processing.
      - 3. The Cloud Function uses Cloud Vision to extract all text from the PDF file.
      - 4. The Cloud Function stores the extracted text inside a Cloud Storage bucket.
      - 5. The Cloud Function uses Vertex AI’s LLM API to summarize the extracted text.
      - 6. The Cloud Function stores the text summaries of PDFs in BigQuery tables.
      - 7. As an alternative to uploading PDF files through Jupyter Notebook, the developer can upload a PDF file directly to a Cloud Storage
      - bucket — for instance, through the Console UI or gcloud. This upload triggers Eventarc to begin the Document Processing phase.
      - 8. As a result of the direct upload to Cloud Storage, Eventarc triggers the Document Processing phase, handled by Cloud Functions.
